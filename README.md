# Task-Tracker

A small app using Python that keeps track of 3 different tasks that I do during the week; learn Spanish, programming and teaching.

You can add and delete tasks and also give descriptions and total time taken for each task.

You can set yourself an overall goal for the week and for each task type i.e. 6 hours of Spanish.

When you add/delete a task it works out the percentage of the total weekly goal and also of the individual task type i.e. 20% of your Spanish goal, 4% of your overall goal.

You can also see lists of all of the tasks that are completed in the week.
